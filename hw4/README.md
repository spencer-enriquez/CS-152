# List Processing in Scala
This assignment is practice list processing in Scala by using iteration, traditional recursion, tail recursion, and pipelining.
The main topics covered in this exercise are Streams, Lists, Cons, and Pipelines (map, filter, reduce).

Problem 17 introduces a basic Accumulator, which takes a list of functions and uses this list to update its internal register.
This process is similar to how Discrete Dynamic Systems run, but using multiple update functions and using the number of functions 
to halt the machine.
