# Recursion in Scala
This assignment was intended to get students acclimated to traditional and tail recursion within Scala. The difference between
tail and traditional recursion is that no additional operations are made on the recursive call, meaning that the space 
complexity can be defined by the programmer and is similar to iteration in runtime.
