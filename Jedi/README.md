# Semester Project: Jedi Programming Language
Jedi is a programming language students were meant to create using Scala as the reference language. Over the duration
of the course, the following topics have been successfully implemented in Jedi: Primitive Types and Operations (Boole, Real, Chars, Integer), 
Functional Programming (Functions, Meta-programming), Variables, Iteration, Pass-by-Text, Pass-by-Value, Pass-By-Name, 
Static / Dynamic Scoping. For more information on the implementation of Jedi, please ask me.

Note: In order to successfully compile and run the project, the following Scala parsing library must be downloaded:
